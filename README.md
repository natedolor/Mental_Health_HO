# Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks
Metadata Updated: April 15, 2023

The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.

# What is this

This project is to assess factors that lead to different mental health care practices over 4 weeks during covid. Using a machine learning model, going off the data on numberical values of Values, HighCI, and LowCI, my model is able to predict what indicator of mental health care groups (Based on gender, race, state, etc.) recieved. My model's accuracy score is around 60% to 90% accuracy. Without metadata I could not accurately make assumptions upon why certain groups chose certain indicators over another but that there are certain correlations in the data that indicate what mental health care they would receive.
